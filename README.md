# N8N Trading Automation Platform

Visual crypto-trading workflow automation built with React Flow, Express,
MongoDB/Mongoose, and a detached Bun executor service.

## Project progress

Measured from the first repository commit (`4684a8a`) through the current
implementation (`23a18f4`):

| Metric | First commit | Current | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| TypeScript files in `apps/` and `packages/` | 7 | 35 | +400% |
| TypeScript lines in `apps/` and `packages/` | 324 | 2,065 | +537% |
| Git commits | 1 | 18 | +17 |

The implementation now includes the visual workflow builder, trigger and task
drawers, workflow persistence, authenticated execution requests, execution
history, recursive detached execution, and an injectable Lighter action handler.

Validation currently passes with:

```sh
bun run build --filter=client
bun run check-types
```

These are delivery and maintainability metrics, not a claimed runtime-speed
benchmark. Runtime performance improvements should be measured separately with
representative workflow and database benchmarks.

## Estimated automation impact

These figures are scenario-based estimates until production execution history
is available:

| Scenario | Calculation | Estimated impact |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Manual trade check replaced by a timer workflow | 5 min/check × 12 checks/day × 22 workdays | 22 hours saved/month |
| Three independent action branches executed in parallel | 9 sec sequential ÷ 4 sec parallel | 56% lower elapsed execution time |
| Workflow launch overhead | 2 sec polling interval ÷ 60 | Up to 2 sec trigger wait |

For measured results after deployment:

```text
time saved = (manual execution time - automated execution time) × successful runs
```

The estimates assume a five-minute manual check, twelve checks per workday,
twenty-two workdays per month, and branch durations of 3, 4, and 2 seconds.
They are projections, not measured performance claims.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended):

```sh
cd my-turborepo
turbo build
```

Without global `turbo`, use your package manager:

```sh
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo build
bun dlx turbo build
bun exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

```sh
turbo build --filter=docs
```

Without global `turbo`:

```sh
npx turbo build --filter=docs
bun exec turbo build --filter=docs
bun exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended):

```sh
cd my-turborepo
turbo dev
```

Without global `turbo`, use your package manager:

```sh
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo dev
bun exec turbo dev
bun exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

```sh
turbo dev --filter=web
```

Without global `turbo`:

```sh
npx turbo dev --filter=web
bun exec turbo dev --filter=web
bun exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.dev/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended):

```sh
cd my-turborepo
turbo login
```

Without global `turbo`, use your package manager:

```sh
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
bun exec turbo login
bun exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

```sh
turbo link
```

Without global `turbo`:

```sh
npx turbo link
bun exec turbo link
bun exec turbo link
```
